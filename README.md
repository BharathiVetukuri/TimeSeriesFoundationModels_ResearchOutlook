## 🧠 Project Summary

Foundation models have revolutionized NLP and vision. This work explores their emerging applications in **time series analysis**, comparing:

- Foundation models trained **from scratch** (e.g., TimeGPT, TimesFM)
- Adapted **LLMs** using embedding-visible and text-visible paradigms
- Evaluated under the **3E framework**: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Explainability
